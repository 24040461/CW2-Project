                                are small group sessions which give you the opportunity to discuss topics in some depth. These are often related to the lectures, but in addition

                    <p>
                        At Edge Hill computer sceicne department the first year students all do the same 
                        modules no matter what degree you picked this allows you as a student to grow but also 
                        not lock you down. You mighy find out through out the year that your degree is not for you 
                        and you enjoy Web Design Devlopment for example so you can easily change if there is space 
                        of course but dont feel that you have already specialized yourself so in reality it is like 
                        a tester year if you like your degree great if not and you enjoy doing something else more
                         then you have had this year to try everything and wont find yourslef being far behind

                    <p>
                        When it comes to freshers try and get yourself out there everyone will be going through the same 
                        difficults but try not to look at other people and think they are better than you go at your own pace 
                        if it is to overwheleming have a rest day just talking to your flat. Remember you have taken a massive 
                        step in your life and to alot of you will be a completly new situation it make take some people longer 
                        than others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if it gets worse and you do feel isolated do remeber at Edge Hill there is a help desk 
                        that will help no matter the probelm so please dont feel scared to reach out to them and
